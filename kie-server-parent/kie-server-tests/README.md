Kie server integration tests
=====================

**This test suite tests the Kie server deployed on various containers like WildFly, EAP 7, Tomcat 8,
Oracle WebLogic 12 and IBM WebSphere 9, using Maven Cargo plugin.** Tests cover mainly functionality of Kie server clients, Kie server controller and Kie server router, also contain several REST tests.

Every extension has own dedicated test module. kie-server-integ-tests-all contains tests covering usage of several extensions in one test.

Tests are run very easily using the command

```mvn clean install -P<container-profile> <container-specific-params>```

where `<container-profile>` is simply a particular container. Another container-specific parameters may also be configured (see the table below).
WildFly, EAP 7 and Tomcat 8 do not have to be pre-installed, they will be downloaded automatically (in case of EAP 7, download URL has to be provided).
Oracle WebLogic 12 and IBM WebSphere 9 have to be pre-installed and the installation path has to be provided using a Maven property `weblogic.home` or `websphere.home` respectively.
Tests are executed using Failsafe plugin. To run specific test class use `-Dit.test=<Test class name>`

Most of the tests can be executed locally as JUnit tests, in this case embedded server is used and only REST endpoints are tested.
To run a test locally in Intellij IDEA add this string to the configuration, it will clear the property that triggers a Cargo build due to probably a bug in the IDE.

```-Dkie.server.base.http.url=```

The following table lists all currently supported combinations of parameters:

| Container to run    | \<container-profile\> | \<container-specific params\>             |
| -----------------   | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
|     WildFly         | wildfly               | *none*                                    |
|     EAP 7           | eap7                  | eap7.download.url                         |
|     Tomcat 9        | tomcat9               | *none*                                    |
| Oracle WebLogic 12  | oracle-wls-12         | weblogic.home                             |
| IBM WebSphere 9*    | websphere9            | websphere.home                            |

\* User used to run tests against WebSphere needs to have write access into WebSphere installation folder, subfolders and files.


## Database configuration
By default, the tests are ran with the H2 database.
